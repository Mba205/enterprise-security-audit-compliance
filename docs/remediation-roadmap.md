# Remediation Roadmap

This document outlines a prioritized remediation roadmap developed as part of the Enterprise Security Audit & Compliance engagement. The roadmap is designed to reduce organizational risk while balancing security effectiveness, operational feasibility, and business impact.

## 1. Remediation Strategy Overview

Remediation actions were prioritized based on:
- Risk severity
- Likelihood of exploitation
- Business impact
- Implementation complexity

The roadmap is structured into short-term, mid-term, and long-term actions to support phased risk reduction.

## 2. Short-Term Remediation (0–30 Days)

### Objective
Address high-risk and easily exploitable weaknesses that present immediate security exposure.

### Key Actions
- Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Exchange and VPN users
- Restrict privileged access and review administrative accounts
- Enable and centralize authentication logging
- Apply critical and high-severity security patches
- Disable legacy or unused access mechanisms

### Expected Impact
- Immediate reduction in credential-based attack risk
- Improved visibility into authentication events
- Reduced likelihood of unauthorized access

## 3. Mid-Term Remediation (30–90 Days)

### Objective
Improve control maturity and operational consistency.

### Key Actions
- Formalize access review procedures and schedules
- Implement vulnerability scanning and patch management cycles
- Enhance log monitoring and alerting
- Update incident response playbooks to include authentication incidents
- Document security configuration baselines

### Expected Impact
- Improved detection and response capabilities
- Reduced configuration drift
- Better audit and compliance readiness

## 4. Long-Term Remediation (90+ Days)

### Objective
Strengthen governance, resilience, and continuous improvement.

### Key Actions
- Integrate security monitoring with SIEM or centralized logging platforms
- Conduct periodic risk reassessments
- Perform regular internal audits and control testing
- Align security metrics with business objectives
- Support continuous security awareness training

### Expected Impact
- Sustainable risk reduction
- Improved security maturity
- Stronger governance and compliance posture

## 5. Ownership and Accountability

Effective remediation requires clearly defined ownership:

| Role | Responsibility |
|----|---------------|
| IT Operations | Patch management, system hardening |
| Security Team | Monitoring, detection, incident response |
| GRC / Compliance | Risk tracking, policy alignment |
| Management | Risk acceptance and resource allocation |

## 6. Residual Risk Management

Not all risks can be fully mitigated immediately. Residual risks should be:
- Documented
- Reviewed by management
- Accepted or deferred with justification
- Reassessed periodically

## 7. Success Metrics

Remediation effectiveness can be measured using:
- Reduction in high-risk findings
- MFA adoption rates
- Patch compliance percentages
- Mean time to detect (MTTD)
- Mean time to respond (MTTR)

## 8. Continuous Improvement

The remediation roadmap supports ongoing improvement by:
- Encouraging proactive risk management
- Aligning security actions with business priorities
- Supporting future audits and assessments
