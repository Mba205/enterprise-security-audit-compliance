# Audit Methodology

This document describes the structured audit methodology applied during the Enterprise Security Audit & Compliance engagement. The approach reflects industry-aligned Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) practices and is designed to support defensible, repeatable, and risk-based assessments.

## 1. Audit Approach Overview

The audit followed a **risk-based methodology** aligned with NIST SP 800-30 and mapped to enterprise security and compliance frameworks including NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 27001, and SOC 2.

The methodology prioritizes:
- Business impact
- Threat likelihood
- Control effectiveness
- Compliance relevance

This ensures audit efforts focus on areas with the highest organizational risk.

## 2. Planning and Scoping

### 2.1 Objective Definition
Audit objectives were defined to:
- Identify security risks affecting critical enterprise systems
- Evaluate the effectiveness of existing technical and administrative controls
- Assess alignment with recognized security and compliance frameworks
- Provide actionable, prioritized remediation recommendations

### 2.2 Scope Definition
The scope was defined based on:
- System criticality
- Data sensitivity
- Exposure to external threats
- Dependency on business operations

In-scope systems included Microsoft Exchange Server and Cisco AnyConnect VPN.

## 3. Asset Identification and Classification

Assets were identified and classified based on:
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

High-impact assets were prioritized for detailed analysis to ensure audit focus aligned with business risk.

## 4. Threat and Vulnerability Identification

Threat identification considered:
- External threat actors
- Insider threats
- Credential-based attacks
- Exploitation of known vulnerabilities
- Misconfigurations and procedural weaknesses

Vulnerabilities were identified through:
- Configuration reviews
- Policy and documentation review
- Control assessment
- Industry threat intelligence

## 5. Risk Assessment Methodology

Risks were evaluated using a **qualitative risk assessment model**:

| Factor | Description |
|------|------------|
| Likelihood | Probability of threat occurrence |
| Impact | Potential business and security impact |
| Risk Rating | Combined likelihood and impact |

Risk ratings were used to prioritize findings and remediation efforts.

## 6. Control Assessment

Controls were evaluated across:
- Preventive controls
- Detective controls
- Corrective controls

Assessment criteria included:
- Design effectiveness
- Implementation consistency
- Operational maturity

## 7. Gap Analysis

Identified gaps were documented where:
- Controls were missing
- Controls were partially implemented
- Controls were ineffective or inconsistently applied

Each gap was mapped to relevant framework requirements.

## 8. Compliance Mapping

Audit findings were mapped to:
- NIST CSF categories and subcategories
- ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A controls
- SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria

This mapping supports compliance visibility and audit defensibility.

## 9. Risk Treatment and Recommendations

Risk treatment strategies included:
- Risk mitigation through control enhancement
- Risk transfer where applicable
- Risk acceptance with documented justification

Recommendations were prioritized based on risk severity and implementation feasibility.

## 10. Reporting and Communication

Audit results were communicated through:
- Executive summaries for stakeholders
- Detailed technical findings
- Risk registers and remediation roadmaps

Reporting emphasized clarity, traceability, and business relevance.

## 11. Continuous Improvement Considerations

The methodology supports continuous improvement by:
- Encouraging periodic reassessment
- Supporting control maturity tracking
- Aligning with evolving threat landscapes
