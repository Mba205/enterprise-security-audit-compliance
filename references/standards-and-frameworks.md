# Standards, Frameworks, and Authoritative References

This document lists the primary standards, frameworks, and authoritative sources referenced throughout the Enterprise Security Audit & Compliance case study. These sources informed the audit methodology, risk assessment approach, control evaluation, and compliance mapping.

## 1. NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
Used to structure risk identification, protection, detection, and response activities.

- https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework

Relevant functions applied:
- Identify (ID)
- Protect (PR)
- Detect (DE)
- Respond (RS)

### NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1  
**Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments**

Primary reference for:
- Threat identification
- Vulnerability analysis
- Likelihood and impact evaluation
- Risk determination

## 2. ISO/IEC Standards

### ISO/IEC 27001:2022  
**Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)**

Used to align audit findings with internationally recognized security control domains.

Key Annex A control families referenced:
- A.5 — Information Security Policies
- A.8 — Asset Management
- A.9 — Access Control
- A.12 — Operations Security
